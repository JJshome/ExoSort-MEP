## Key Papers

### 1. Deterministic Sorting of Submicrometer Particles and Extracellular Vesicles Using a Combined Electric and Acoustic Field

**Authors**: Tayebi Mahnoush, Yang Dahou, Collins David J, Ai Ye  
**Journal**: Nano Letters (2021)  
**PMID**: 34355908  
**DOI**: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01827

**Summary**:  
This study demonstrates an approach using both electrical and acoustic forces to manipulate bioparticles and submicrometer particles for deterministic sorting. The researchers found that the concurrent application of dielectrophoretic (DEP) and acoustophoretic forces decreases the critical diameter at which particles can be separated. They utilized this approach to sort subpopulations of extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes (<200 nm) and microvesicles (>300 nm), achieving exosome purification with more than 95% purity and 81% recovery.

### 2. Dielectrophoresis Low and High Crossover Frequencies of Cancerous Exosomes

**Authors**: Nakano Michihiko, Nakabayashi Ryu, Koyama Rie, Inaba Masafumi, Suehiro Junya  
**Journal**: Electrophoresis (2025)  
**PMID**: 40047310  
**DOI**: 10.1002/elps.8128

**Summary**:  
This paper investigates the dielectrophoretic characteristics of exosomes derived from four cancer cell lines: MCF-7, PC-3, HT-29, and COLO 201. The researchers determined the DEP crossover frequencies of these exosomes by directly observing their DEP behaviors at various suspension medium conductivities. Each exosome type exhibited distinct dielectrophoretic characteristics, with significant differences in the lower crossover frequencies linked to variations in the membrane properties and inner conductivity. A single-shell dielectric model was used to estimate the dielectric and physical parameters of the exosomes.

### 3. Small Extracellular Vesicles Detection by Dielectrophoresis-Based Microfluidic Chip

**Authors**: Lan Mei, Wu Di, Cheng Cheng, et al.  
**Journal**: Analytical Chemistry (2025)  
**PMID**: 40055868  
**DOI**: 10.1021/acs.analchem.4c06592

**Summary**:  
This study introduces a novel, fast, and efficient acDEP-sEV immunochip that combines dielectrophoresis (DEP) with immunoaffinity methods. By filling the chip reaction chamber with antibody-conjugated microbeads, a nonuniform electric field can be constructed, laminar flow can be disrupted, mass transfer efficiency can be improved, and fluorescence signals can be focused. This approach achieved rapid, sensitive, and adjustable small extracellular vesicle (sEV) capture and detection, requiring only 20-50 μL of plasma sample for liquid biopsy in less than 35 minutes. The chip achieved a low limit of detection of 54 sEV/μL.

### 4. High-precision extracellular-vesicle isolation-analysis integrated platform for rapid cancer diagnosis

**Authors**: Park Minsu, Lee Chan-Hyeong, Noh Hyowoong, et al.  
**Journal**: Biosensors & Bioelectronics (2025)  
**PMID**: 39442437  
**DOI**: 10.1016/j.bios.2024.116863

**Summary**:  
This paper proposes an isolation-analysis-integrated cancer-diagnosis platform based on dielectrophoresis(DEP)-ELISA technique which enables a three orders of magnitude higher sensitivity over conventional ELISA method and direct cancer diagnosis from blood plasma with high accuracy. The platform demonstrates the potential for sEV-based liquid biopsy by achieving isolation of sEVs with high purity and cancer-sEV detection with extremely high sensitivity.

### 5. A Novel Microfluidic Strategy for Efficient Exosome Separation

**Authors**: Wang Dayin, Yang Shijia, Wang Ning, et al.  
**Journal**: Biosensors (2024)  
**PMID**: 38667167  
**DOI**: 10.3390/bios14040174

**Summary**:  
This research presents a novel microfluidic strategy based on thermally oxidized deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) arrays with tapered shapes to enhance exosome separation performance. The researchers achieved more than 90% purity in both polystyrene nanoparticle and exosome experiments. Additionally, they created a simulation model that integrates dielectrophoresis (DEP) to overcome the size-based limitations of DLD and distinguish particles that are close in size but differ in biochemical compositions.

## Relevance to Membrane Potential-Based Sorting

While the patent application focuses specifically on sorting extracellular vesicles based on membrane potential differences, the current scientific literature demonstrates various approaches to EV separation using electrical properties. The dielectrophoretic methods described in these papers are related to the patent concept as they exploit the electrical characteristics of EVs for separation.

The studies show that:

1. Dielectrophoresis can effectively separate EVs based on their electrical properties
2. Cancer-derived EVs show distinct dielectrophoretic behaviors
3. Combined approaches (e.g., DEP with immunoaffinity or acoustic forces) can enhance separation efficiency
4. Microfluidic platforms can achieve high sensitivity and specificity for EV detection

These findings support the feasibility of the patent's approach to sort EVs based on membrane potential differences using electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis. The patent extends this concept by specifically focusing on membrane potential as the distinguishing characteristic, which could provide additional selectivity in targeting EVs for medical applications.
